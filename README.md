## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Pattern**
  - Base components (Button, FormInput, etc.)
  - Composite components (DataTable, Pagination)
  - Feature-specific components (EmployeeDetails, TimesheetList)
  - Page layouts and containers

### Separation of Concerns
1. **Presentation Layer**
   - React components for UI rendering
   - Styled with TailwindCSS
   - Responsive design patterns

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Custom hooks for state management
   - Form validation logic
   - Data transformation utilities

3. **Data Layer**
   - Type definitions
   - API integration
   - Data fetching logic


## Technical Implementation

### Form Handling
- Controlled components
- Real-time validation
- Error handling
- File upload management

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Props for component communication

### Styling
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Responsive design
- Dark/Light mode support
- Consistent component styling

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized image handling
- Pagination for large datasets
- Memoization where appropriate

## Best Practices

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management

### Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces
- Prop type validation
- Strict null checks
- Type guards where necessary

### Error Handling
- Form validation
- API error handling
- User feedback
- Graceful degradation

### Code Quality
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier formatting
- Consistent naming conventions
- Component documentation

## Security Features
- Input sanitization
- File upload validation
- Type checking
- Secure routing

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced reporting
- Batch operations
- Export functionality
- Integration with external systems
- Advanced analytics

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow component composition patterns
2. Maintain type safety
3. Write unit tests for new features
4. Document complex logic
5. Follow accessibility guidelines
